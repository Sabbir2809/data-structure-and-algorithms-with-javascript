# Data Structure & Algorithms with JavaScript

An algorithm is a set well-defined instructions to solve a particular problem. Well defined inputs & outputs. Each step should be clear & unambiguous. Language independent.

## Why Algorithms?

- As a developer, you're going to come across problem that you need to solve.
- Learning algorithms translates to learning different techniques to efficiently solve those problems
- One problem can be solved in many ways using different algorithms.

## Algorithms:

1. Measuring Performance
1. Time & Space Complexity
1. Big O Notation
1. Performance & Optimization (Good Code: readable, scalable)
1. Math Algorithms
1. Recursion
1. Searching Algorithms

   - Liner Search
   - Binary Search

1. Sorting Algorithms

   - Bubble Sort
   - Selection Sort
   - Insertion Sort
   - Merge Sort
   - Quick Sort
